# To-Do List Webpage

This is a simple To-Do List application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to `add`, `mark as complete`, and `delete` tasks.

## Features

1. **Add Tasks**:
   - Users can add tasks by entering text into the input field and clicking the `Add` button or pressing the `Enter` key.

2. **Mark Tasks as Complete**:
   - Clicking on a task will toggle a strike-through(line-through) style to indicate completion.

3. **Delete Tasks**:
   - Each task has a `Delete` button that allows users to remove the task from the list.
